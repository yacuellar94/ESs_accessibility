Datasets used in the article:

The input folder contains 26 items used as entries to assess habitat quality and residents' accessibility to urban wetlands.

* Inputs used in the Habitat Quality-Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model:

1) Constructions, crops, population, land use, and land cover: for 1998, 2010, 2022, and 2034.
2) Network road: divided into intermediate and principal roads for 2010 and 2034.
3) Wrong connections: places where the wastewater network is connected with the urban wetlands.
4) Waste points: waste points are places near the urban wetlands.

* Inputs used in the accessibility analysis
1) Administrative localities
2) Wetland locations

The output folder contains nine items as a result of the Habitat Quality-InVEST model and the Network analysis.

* Outputs of the Habitat Quality-InVEST model
1) Habitat Quality and Habitat Degradation: for 1998, 2010, and 2034.
2) Global Moran's I: Spatial autocorrelation analysis to examine the spatial distribution characteristics of HQ in Bogota’s urban wetlands for 1998, 2022, and 2034.
3) Bivariate Moran's I: spatial autocorrelation between the wetlands' habitat quality and the quality of life index for 2010 and 2022.

* Outputs of the Network Analysis
1) Accessibility: The accessibility indicators were calculated considering time, proximity, and proximity-wetlands’ habitat quality.
